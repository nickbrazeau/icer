\title{Creates composition levels from the infection compositions}
\usage{
find_composition_level(nms, perms)
}
\arguments{
\item{nms}{Names of the species we are looking at.}

\item{perms}{List of outputs of \code{moi_perms}.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of vectors that correspond to the infection types
  of the infection compostions given within `perms`
}
\description{
Creates composition levels from the infection compositions
}
\details{
For each matrix of moi permutations within `perms`, each row
  is used to work out the infection type from the infection composition.
  E.g. if the row of the matrix is [2, 1, 0] and our `nms` are [a, b, c]
  then the infeciton composition is "a/a/b" but the observed infection
  type will be "a/b"
}
\examples{
\dontrun{


nms <- obj@casenames
perms <- lapply(1:2, moi_perms, n = 3)

find_composition_level(nms,perms)

#> [[1]]
#> [1] "c" "a" "b"
#>
#> [[2]]
#> [1] "c"   "a/c" "a"   "b/c" "a/b" "b"

}

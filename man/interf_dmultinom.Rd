\usage{
interf_dmultinom(x, prob, k, interf)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of length equal to `data` of integers in `0:sum(data)`.}

\item{prob}{Numeric non-negative vector of length `length(data)`, specifying
the probability for classes; is internally normalized to sum 1.
Infinite and missing values are not allowed.}

\item{k}{Interference parameters. See details.}

\item{interf}{Interference relationships. Output of \code{interf_pair_pos}}
}
\value{
Returns probability density vector of length equal to `length(prob)`
}
\description{
Interference mutlinomial distribution
}
\details{
Interference parameters describe how the probability density of
  `dmultionom(x, prob=prob)` is altered depending on which is the first draw
  from the mutlinomial distribution.

  Two types of interference parameter can be specified. For example:

  Modulators, which should be passed as a named vector, with names "k<n>":

  `k = c("k0"=0.5)` - The probability of choosing the same event as the first
   drawn event will be mutliplied by 0.5
  `k = c("k1"=0.5,"k2"=2)` - The probability of choosing the first element in
   x again if it was drawn first will be multiplied by 0.5, whereas if the
   second element was drawn first then the probability of picking it again is
   doubled.
   drawn event will be mutliplied by 0.5

  Interferences, passed as a named vector, with names "k_<n>_<m>":

  `k = c("k_1_2" = 0.5, "k_1_3" = 2, "k_2_3")` - The probability of choosing
   event 1 if event 2 drawn first is half, and vice versa. The probability
   of drawing event 1 if event 3 was drawn first is doubled, and vice versa.
   The probability of drawing event 2 if event 3 was drawn first is doubled,
   and vice versa.
   drawn event will be mutliplied by 0.5
   Interferences are thus symmetrical between events.
